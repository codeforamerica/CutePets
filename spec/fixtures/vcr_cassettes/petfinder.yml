        and Joey3 yearsNeutered malesMy owner did not have enough time for us and
        the new baby.  Hi!  We''re Patrick and Joey, two playful ferrets looking for
        a great home.  We like ferret kibble and peanut butter treats, and we are
        litter box trained, so we are very neat.  We are very energetic and mischievous.  If
        you are looking for some fun new playmates, we are your guys!We are not picky
        about our housing - a basic ferret setup is fine for us, as long as we have
        enough room to move around.  Take us home today!**We are already neutered,
        so we can go home with you right away!!**"},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"M"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"MA38"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2014-08-28T03:21:13Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30078059/1/?bust=1409196072&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30078059/1/?bust=1409196072&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30078059/1/?bust=1409196072&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30078059/1/?bust=1409196072&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/30078059/1/?bust=1409196072&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"}]}},"id":{"$t":"30078059"},"animal":{"$t":"Small
